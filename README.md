This repository introduces the simulation of red blood cell aggregation using depletion force approach. 
This simulation is mainly for __demonstration__ purposes, not to physically study the phenomenon. 
Further modification of the code as well as its verification is required in order to use it for scientific purposes. 

## Usage

See __Example.ipynb__ file.
